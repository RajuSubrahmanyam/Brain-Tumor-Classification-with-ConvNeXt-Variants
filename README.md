# Brain-Tumor-Classification-with-ConvNeXt-Variants
This repository contains the implementation of a deep learning project for classifying brain tumors using various ConvNeXt models. The project explores the performance of different ConvNeXt variants (e.g., Tiny, Small, Base, and Large) on a brain tumor dataset.
